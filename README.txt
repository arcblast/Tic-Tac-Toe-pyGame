Python 3
Pygame module
Problems encountered
I forgot how to make a copy of an array because I thought newArr= oldArr was enough.
My biggest issue was myminmax algorithm kept returning a terminal state no matter 
the current state of the board.
How were they resolved?
Google, YT and pen and paper tracing. I kept wondering why minmax() kept returning only
terminal states then I realized my return state was wrong.
Lessons learned
Programming is hard.
